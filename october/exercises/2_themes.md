### 2. Themes

Themes actually have very few requirements. Check out the documentation and compare it with the demo theme. 

Most of what constitutes the theme can be generated and edited from the CMS backend: pages, partials, layouts, content. You can even create a theme from the settings tab in the backend. 

As an exercise, you could create a theme, the layouts, the assets, etc. That's not very complicated and you can probably just skip that.

_One consideration:_

_The website's pages are listed within the theme folder. Does it have to be this way? What if you want to change theme while leaving the same pages? Is there a way around that?_
